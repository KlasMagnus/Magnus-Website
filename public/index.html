                <p>Hi, I'm Magnus! I used to be a journalist but five years ago I switched careers and have been working full-time as a software developer ever since. I love it!<br>
                </p>
                <p>

                    </figure>
                </p>
                    
                <p>               
                    I've mostly done back end work but I'm now diving into web development.<br>
                    The idea behind this site is :<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>For me to <i>learn more about web development by building things and posting them here!</i></li>
                    <li>And also to <i>visualize my own learning when it comes to software development.</i></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Because learning is fun!<br>
                

                </p>

                <h3> Magnus's Handy ToolBox</h3>
                <p>The Toolbox contains a bunch of Windows applications I wrote to make my workdays easier.<br>
                    It takes the form of a dashboard and contains time reporting tools connected to Outlook for my consulting work as well as
                    cryptography tools.<br></p>
                    <p>It's written in C# as a WPF Application using the MVVM Design Pattern.<br>
                    The idea to use this pattern was born out of my frustration with WinForms applications and how the GUI code runs a high risk to be very tightly coupled to your business logic.
                    I had a lot of fun learning this and I think it's a shame the WPF style with XAML hasn't been more widely adopted. (Even though I understand why, prototyping stuff in Winforms is FAST!)
