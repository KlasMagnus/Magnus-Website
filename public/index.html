        <p>Welcome to my Site. <br>
            The main focus of this website is two-fold:<br>
             For me to <i>learn more about web development</i><br>
            and to <i>visualize my own learning process.</i><br>
            Because learning is fun!
            
        </p>
        <h2>My ongoing projects</h2>
        <h3> Windows ToolBox</h3>
        <p>Windows applications I wrote to make repetitive day-to-day work tasks more fun.<br>
       The toolbox takes the form of a dashboard includes time reporting tools for my consulting work as well as cryptography tools.<br>
       It's written in C# as a WPF Application using the MVVM Design Pattern.<br>
