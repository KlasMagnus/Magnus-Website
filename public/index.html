    <p>Hi, I'm Magnus. Welcome! <br>
        I used to be a journalist but I switched careers and for five years<br>
        I've been working full-time as a software developer.<br>
        The idea behind this site is two-fold:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>It's an opportunity for me to <i>learn more about web development</i></li>
        <li>and to <i>visualize my own learning process.</i></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Because learning is fun!<br>

    That's me next to a plastic hippo.

    <h2>Ongoing projects</h2>
    <h3> Magnus's Handy ToolBox</h3>
    <p>The Toolbox contains a bunch of Windows applications I wrote to make my workdays easier.<br>
        The toolbox is a dashboard which includes time reporting tools connected to Outlook for my consulting work as well as
        cryptography tools.<br></p>
        <p>It's written in C# as a WPF Application using the MVVM Design Pattern.<br>
        The idea to use this pattern was born out of my frustration with WinForms applications and how the GUI code runs a high risk to be very tightly coupled to your business logic.
        I had a lot of fun learning this and I think it's a shame the WPF style with XAML wasn't more widely adopted.
